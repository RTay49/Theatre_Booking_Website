Notes.

-Please Start at "Home.php" as this is the intended home page.


-Most plays only show once a day making the book time page redundant in most cases.
 However the Production "Les MisraMinBabyBells" is a shorter play that can be performed twice on certain days. 
 If you wish to investigate the booktime function I suggest selecting "Les MisraMinBabyBells" as the production as it gives you more options when selecting times.
